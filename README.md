# apptainer-examples
Four examples of apptainer applications
1: Simple python app printing "Hello world!"
2: More complicated python app rolling dices for input users and saving the total tally of dicerolls in a json file.
3: Same as the second python app, but has an intermediate save step to showcase the limits of writability in apptainer apps
4: Bioinformatics application that runs on the GPU, and returns embeddings of input fasta files for given language models.
